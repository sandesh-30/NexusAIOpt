## üåü Purpose  
This repository is a collaborative effort to compile, implement, and share solutions to a diverse range of problems in **Operations Research (OR)**, **Mathematical Optimization**, **Supply Chain Analytics**, and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. By gathering algorithms, ideas, and solutions from various sources‚Äîincluding original work, research papers, and books‚Äîwe aim to promote awareness and application of OR methods in solving real-world challenges.  


## üîç What You'll Find  
Each sub-folder focuses on a specific topic or problem and contains:
- **Problem Statements**: Detailed descriptions outlining real-world or simulated scenarios in need of optimization and analysis.  
- **Simulated Data**: Datasets in formats like CSV, Excel, and JSON to facilitate hands-on experimentation.  
- **Solutions**: Implementations in Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) or Python scripts (`.py`). These solutions may include:  
  - Original ideas and algorithms.  
  - Implementations of established methods from research papers, books, or other credible sources.  
- **References**: When applicable, we include citations to the sources of algorithms or problem formulations.
